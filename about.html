          Hi! I'm a 12-year-old web developer who loves creating websites and learning new things about technology. I'm currently studying web development as part of my ICT class, and I've already learned a lot about HTML and CSS.

          I'm always curious and love experimenting with new designs and features. I built this portfolio to share some of the cool projects I'm working on, and I hope to keep adding more as I learn JavaScript and other fun tools!
          
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing games, exploring how things work, and coming up with creative ideas for websites and apps.
          
          Thanks for visiting my portfolio!
        </p>
